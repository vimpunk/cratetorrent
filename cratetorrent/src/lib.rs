//! `cratetorrent` is a peer-to-peer file-sharing engine implementing the
//! BitTorrent version 1 protocol.
//!
//! It is built on top of [`tokio`](https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.16/tokio/) for
//! async IO.
//!
//! # Caveats
//!
//! The engine currently only supports Linux. This is expected to change in the
//! future, however.
//!
//! It also lacks most features present in battle-hardened torrent engines, such
//! as [libtorrent](https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent). These include: DHT
//! for peer exchange, magnet links, stream encryption, UDP trackers, and many
//! more.
//!
//! Therefore in the current state of the project, this should only be viewed as
//! a toy program.
//!
//! # The engine
//!
//! Users of the library will be interacting with the [engine](crate::engine),
//! which drives uploads and downloads (in short, torrents).
//!
//! As a first step of using cratetorrent, the engine needs to be spawned and
//! started. This must happen within a tokio context--that is, on a task
//! already spawned on the tokio executor. A useful macro for this is
//! [`tokio::main`](https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.16/tokio/attr.main.html).
//!
//! The engine may be configured via the types in the [`conf`] module, though
//! options at the moment are fairly limited.
//!
//! # Downloading
//!
//! To start a download, as decribed above, the cratetorrent engine has to be
//! already running.
//!
//! Then, the [metainfo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrent_file) of the
//! torrent needs to be constructed. This, as its name suggests, contains
//! metadata about the torrent. It will be most commonly be downloaded as a file
//! from a torrent tracker.
//!
//! This then can be read in as a file and parsed into
//! a [`Metainfo`](crate::metainfo::Metainfo) instance using its
//! [constructor](crate::metainfo::Metainfo::from_bytes). This will fail if the
//! metainfo is semantically or syntactically invalid.
//!
//! Note that in order to download a torrent the metainfo has to contain HTTP
//! trackers, or some seeds have to be manually specified. As mentioned above,
//! DHT or even UDP trackers are not currently supported.
//!
//! Once this is done, a command to the engine has to be sent to create the
//! torrent. This is done using
//! [`EngineHandle::create_torrent`](crate::engine::EngineHandle::create_torrent),
//! which takes a [`TorrentParams`](crate::engine::TorrentParams) instance for
//! the torrent's parameters.
//!
//! Also included is an option to override the global torrent configuration
//! (passed to engine, as mentioned above) via
//! [`TorrentConf`](crate::conf::TorrentConf). If not set, the global
//! configuration is used for all new torrents, but this way it is possible to
//! configure a torrent on a case-by-case basis.
//!
//! For now, the torrent's download mode has to be specified via `Mode`:
//! whether to download or seed (upload) the torrent. If the latter is chosen,
//! the torrent's contents _have_ to exist in the directory specified as the
//! torrent's download directory in `TorrentConf`.
//!
//! ## Full example of a download
//!
//! An example download of an arbitrary torrent download that exits a soon as
//! the download is complete might look like this:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cratetorrent::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     // spawn the engine with a default config
//!     let conf = Conf::new("/tmp/downloads");
//!     let (engine, mut alert_rx) = engine::spawn(conf)?;
//!
//!     // parse torrent metainfo and start the download (use tokio::fs)
//!     let metainfo = std::fs::read("/tmp/imaginary.torrent")?;
//!     let metainfo = Metainfo::from_bytes(&metainfo)?;
//!     let torrent_id = engine.create_torrent(TorrentParams {
//!         metainfo,
//!         // tell the engine to assign a randomly chosen free port
//!         listen_addr: None,
//!         mode: Mode::Download { seeds: Vec::new() },
//!         conf: None,
//!     })?;
//!
//!     // listen to alerts from the engine
//!     while let Some(alert) = alert_rx.recv().await {
//!         match alert {
//!             Alert::TorrentStats { id, stats } => {
//!                 println!("{}: {:#?}", id, stats);
//!             }
//!             Alert::TorrentComplete(id) => {
//!                 println!("{} complete, shutting down", id);
//!                 break;
//!             }
//!             Alert::Error(e) => {
//!                 // this is where you'd handle recoverable errors
//!                 println!("Engine error: {}", e);
//!             }
//!             _ => (),
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     // Don't forget to call shutdown on the engine to gracefully stop all
//!     // entities in the engine. This will wait for announcing the client's
//!     // leave to all trackers of torrent, finish pending disk and network IO,
//!     // as well as wait for peer connections to cleanly shut down.
//!     engine.shutdown().await?;
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Seeding
//!
//! Seeding is fairly analogous to the above.
//!
//! The major differences are that the torrent mode has to be specified as
//! [`Mode::Seed`](crate::engine::Mode::Seed) and that the engine won't send
//! a notification of completion, as the concept is not applicable to
//! seeding--it's indefinite until the user stops it.
//!
//! Therefore the application must make sure to provide its own way of stopping
//! the download.
